## Inspiration
AnotherKafkaMonitor is an app which used to monitor kafka producer and consumer progress inspried by [KafkaOffsetMonitor](https://github.com/quantifind/KafkaOffsetMonitor). It aims to help you figure out what's going on in your kafka cluster, that's to say, to understand how fast the producer send message to the kafka or whether the consumer is far behind the producer or not, if lag exceeds threshold, you will be noticed through alarm email.

## Difference
We are going to list the difference between [KafkaOffsetMonitor](https://github.com/quantifind/KafkaOffsetMonitor) and [AnotherKafkaMonitor](https://github.com/triffic-tang/AnotherKafkaMonitor)
* AnotherKafkaMonitor is much lightweight compared with KafkaOffsetMonitor;
* AnotherKafkaMonitor is implemented by `Java`, Not `Scala` which KafkaOffsetMonitor be implemented.

## Future Plan
We are going to make some big step in the future, like below(JUST FOR NOW):
* Add `SMS` notice module;
* Support more shell command in the future
* ...
